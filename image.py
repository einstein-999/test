Then see this script for converting OpenCV Haar Cascades into a format your OpenMV Cam can read.</p></div><p>Q: What is a Haar Cascade?</p><p>A: A Haar Cascade is a series of contrast checks that are used to determine if an object is present in the image. The contrast checks are split of into stages where a stage is only run if previous stages have already passed. The contrast checks are simple things like checking if the center vertical of the image is lighter than the edges. Large area checks are performed first in the earlier stages followed by more numerous and smaller area checks in later stages.</p><p>Q: How are Haar Cascades made?</p><p>A: Haar Cascades are made by training the generator algorithm against positive and negative labeled images. For example, you’d train the generator algorithm against hundreds of pictures with cats in them that have been labeled as images with cats and against hundreds of images with not cat like things labeled differently. The generator algorithm will then produce a Haar Cascade that detects cats.</p>

GRAYSCALE images are directly converted to unsigned 8-bit <code>ndarray</code> objects. For signed 8-bit <code>ndarray</code> objects the values (0:255) are mapped to (-127:128). For float 32-bit <code>ndarray</code> objects the values are mapped to (0.0:255.0). RGB565 images are converted to 3-channel <code>ndarray</code> objects and the same process described above for GRAYSCALE images is applied to each channel depending on <code>dtype</code>. Note that <code>dtype</code> also accepts the integer values (e.g. <code>ord()</code>) of <code>b</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>f</code> respectively.</p><p><code>buffer</code> if not <code>None</code> is a <code>bytearray</code> object to use as the buffer for the <code>ndarray</code>. If <code>None</code> a new buffer is allocated on the heap to store the <code>ndarray</code> image data. You can use the <code>buffer</code> argument to directly allocate the <code>ndarray</code> in a pre-allocated buffer saving a heap allocation and a copy operation.</p><p>The <code>ndarray</code> returned has the shape of <code>(height, width)</code> for GRAYSCALE images and <code>(height, width, 3)</code> for RGB565 images.</p>

For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - which are minimums and maximums for the LAB L, A, and B channels respectively.

However, many operations when applied on bitmap images don’t make any sense becuase bitmap images only have 2 values. OpenMV recommends using bitmap images for <code>mask</code> values in operations and such as they fit on the MicroPython heap quite easily. Finally, bitmap image pixel values 0 and 1 are interpreted as black and white when being applied to <code>sensor.GRAYSCALE</code> or <code>sensor.RGB565</code> images.
